## Overview

The {pixarfilms} R package has been added to the {dm} R package, which is a
package "for working with multiple related tables, stored as data frames or in a
relational database."

Because all of the tables created in {pixarfilms} are connected by each film,
this gives an interesting opportunity to explore these interconnected tables
together.
